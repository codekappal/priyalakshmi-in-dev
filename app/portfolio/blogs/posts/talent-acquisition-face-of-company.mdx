Every great story starts with TA. Yes, Talent Acquisition team holds a great responsiblity in writing a new story for a candidate. We are the face of a company, very first person the candidate sees / hears from. We are the first to engage with candidates, be it through outreach or application responses or initial screening calls. That first interaction shapes how they see us - our culture, values, and professionalism. Every touchpoint matters: how we greet, how we listen, how we follow up etc,. A strong experience builds trust and excitement. A poor one closes the door too soon. Even if they don’t join us, the experience we create walks with them — into their network, into future opportunities, into our reputation. Hance, TA is not just hiring but it is Branding !
